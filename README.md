## Problem description

You're tasked with building a debounced search bar for products from [DummyJSON's product API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#search). In case you're not familiar with the concept of _debouncing_, it's a technique that allows one to delay a function's execution until a specific amount of time has elapsed since the last call.

For this challenge, you'll need to add a 300-millisecond delay to the `findProducts` function. You can make use of readily available debounce implementations, or try writing one yourself.

You'll also need to display a generic loading spinner/message, and if the function executes successfully, place suggested products' names and price tags inside an unordered list. Otherwise, use native `alert()` to show a generic error message.

If the search term gets reset back to an empty string, clear the search suggestions too.
